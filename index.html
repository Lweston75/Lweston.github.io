  <p>Hello, I am a 45 year old male living in St Charles MO. I dont really know what to put here at the moment.  So I am going to make things up as I go along. 
    This is where i am going to show that I can <strong>BOLD</strong> type while creating my new <em>webpage</em>.  
    This is going to be great&mdash;I am so excited I can hardly contain <strong>myself</strong>.  But <strong>SERIOUSLY</strong> I can cantain myself.</p>
  <br> 
  <p>This is my second <strong>paragraph</strong> in my new <em>webpage</em>.  More to come later.</p>
